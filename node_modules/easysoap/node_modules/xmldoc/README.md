## Introduction

`xmldoc` lets you parse XML documents with ease. It's a pure-JavaScript, one-file XML document class with a single dependency on the excellent [`sax`][sax] parser.

For more on why I wrote this class, see the [blog post][blog].

## Installation

    npm install xmldoc

Or just download the repository and include it in your `node_modules` directly. Or just download the [single JS file][blob]!

  [blob]: https://github.com/nfarina/xmldoc/blob/master/lib/xmldoc.js

## Usage

    var xmldoc = require('../lib/xmldoc');

    var document = new xmldoc.XmlDocument("<some>xml</some>");

    ... do things

## Classes

The primary exported class is `XmlDocument`, which you'll use to consume your XML text. `XmlDocument` contains a hierarchy of `XmlElement` instances representing the XML structure.

Both `XmlElement` and `XmlDocument` contain the same members and methods you can call to traverse the document or a subtree.

## Members

* `name` - the node name, like "tat" for `<tat>`.
* `attr` - an object dict containing attribute properties, like `bookNode.attr.title` for `<book title="...">`.
* `val` - the string "value" of the node, if any, like "world" for `<hello>world</hello>`.
* `children` - an array of `XmlElement` children of the node.

Each member defaults to a sensible "empty" value like `{}` for `attr`, `[]` for `children`, and `""` for `val`.

## Methods

All methods with `child` in the name operate only on direct children; they do not do a deep/recursive search.

* `eachChild(func)` - similar to [underscore's][underscore] `each` method, it will call `func(child, index, array)` for each child of the given node.

* `childNamed(name)` - pass it the name of a child node and it will search for and return the first one found, or `undefined`.

* `childrenNamed(name)` - like `childNamed` but returns all matching children in an array, or `[]`.

* `childWithAttribute(name,value)` - searches for the first child with the given attribute value. You can omit `value` to just find the first node with the given attribute defined at all.

* `descendantWithPath(path)` - searches for a specific "path" uses dot notation.

Example:

    <book>
      <author>
        <name isProper="true">George R. R. Martin</name>
        ...
      </author>
      ...
    </book>

If you just want the `<name>` node and you have the `XmlElement` for the `<book>` node, you can say:

    var nameNode = bookNode.descendantWithPath("author.name"); // return <name> node

* `valueWithPath(path)` - just like `descendantWithPath`, but goes deeper and extracts the `val` of the node.

Example:

    var authorName = bookNode.valueWithPath("author.name"); // return "George R. R. Martin"

You can also use the `@` character to request the value of a particular _attribute_ instead:

    var authorIsProper = bookNode.valueWithPath("author.name@isProper"); // return "true"

This is not [XPath][]! It's just a thing I made up, OK?

* `toString()` - this is just an override of the standard JavaScript method, it will give you the pretty-printed string representation of your XML document or element. Note that this is for debugging only! It will truncate any long node values.
